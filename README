PUT method
----------
1) Transfers the file as chunks to the 4 DFS servers. 
2) The storage space for the chunks will depend on MD5 value of the file
3) Can also opt to place the files in subfolders
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GET method
----------
1) Gets the chunks from the four servers
2) Traffic optimisation is performed such that only four chunks are received from the four servers
3) If few servers are out, the file will be recoverd from the active servers if possible. If not, it says as file incomplete
4) can also retrive files from the sub folders
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
